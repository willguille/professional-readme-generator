  ## Description
  
  The Professional README Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file for a new project. The application uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user for information about the application repository, and then generates a high-quality, professional README file based on the user's input.

  The generated README includes sections for the project's title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information. The README also includes a table of contents that links to each section.
  
  ## Table of Contents
  
  * [Installation](#installation)
  * [Usage](#usage)
  * [License](#license)
  * [Contributing](#contributing)
  * [Tests](#tests)
